# Pokemon-Catch-Probability
Meant to be ran along Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow, Red/Green/Blue, Gold/Silver/Crystal to give live updates of catch probabilities;
I don't condone piracy :) I assume if you're using this that you have bought a copy

THIS IS A MEMORY READER, i.e., Windows will think it's a virus.

This works for 64-bit Windows 11, with visual boy advance version 2.1.5
Works for all 3 American and Japanese versions

Be sure that when Pokemon Version is on, that the games read exactly as listed on the Pokeman.csv

Hit S'Go when the game is running, it should have three probabilities;
When entering into battle with a wild pokemon, the probabilities should change

BUG: You may notice that the probabilities for gen 2 read nan%, this should change to the proper probabililties
when encountering a Pokemon. In Crystal, the probabilities should fluctuate when there is an animation playing, 
and settle to the correct values after the animation stops.
  Right now, the program crashes if the emulator window is hidden o exited. Will fix soon

Next:
gen 3 and 4 support, and other emulators
Prettier GUI
32-bit version is like 4 lines of code different I should just make a 32-bit version..
