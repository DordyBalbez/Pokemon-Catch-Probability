# Pokemon-Catch-Probability
Meant to be ran along Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow to give live updates of catch probabilities;
I don't condone piracy :) I assume if you're using this that you have bought a copy

THIS IS A MEMORY READER, i.e., Windows will think it's a virus.

This works for 64-bit Windows 11, with visual boy advance version 2.1.5
Works for all 3 American and Japanese versions

Be sure that when Pokemon Version is on, that the visual boy advance window reads exactly as one of the following: 

Pokemon Red - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5

Pokemon Blue - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5

Pokemon - Yellow Version - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5

Pocket Monsters - Red Version - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5

Pocket Monsters - Green Version - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5

Pocket Monsters - Blue Version - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5

Hit S'Go when the game is running, it should have three probabilities:

Ultraball: 0.66%

Greatball: 0.5%

Pokeball: 0.39%

When entering into battle with a wild pokemon, the probabilities should change

 ===========================================================================

Version 2 is out and is much larger. I decided to release it as a directory instead of one executable. This iteration will only work if the executable is in the 
folder, and so you'll need to copy and paste a shortcut if you'd like to have it somewhere else. Functionally, its the same as v1.618, but this version will soon 
see support for much more games and emulators that will be much easier to implement with just adding changes to the .csv instead of the script. Also, instead of 
ensuring that you have the games as titled above, you can change edit the .csv to match the title of the window you are playing. If you're comfortable finding 
offsets and pointers yourself, you can add to the excel file. This makes it easy to run modded versions of the game, so long as you know which base version it's 
based on.

Next:
Support for later gens, and other emulators
32-bit version is like 4 lines of code different I should just make a 32-bit version..
