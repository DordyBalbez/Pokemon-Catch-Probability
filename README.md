# Pokemon-Catch-Probability
Mean to be ran along Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow to give live updates of catch probabilities;
I don't condone piracy :) I assume if you're using this that you have bought a copy

THIS IS A MEMORY READER, i.e., Windows will think it's a virus.

This works for 64-bit Windows 11, with visual boy advance version 2.1.5

Be sure that when Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow Version is on, that the visual boy advance window reads exactly as one of the following: 
Pokemon Red - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5
Pokemon Blue - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5
Pokemon - Yellow Version - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5

Hit S'Go when the game is running, it should have three probabilities:
Ultraball: 0.66%
Greatball: 0.5%
Pokeball: 0.39%

When entering into battle with a wild pokemon, the probabilities should change

Next:
Support for later gens, Japanese ROMs, and other emulators
Prettier GUI
32-bit version is like 4 lines of code different I should just make a 32-bit version..
