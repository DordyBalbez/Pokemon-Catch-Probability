THIS IS A MEMORY READER, i.e., Windows will think it's a virus.

This works for 64-bit Windows 11, with visual boy advance version 2.1.4

Be sure that when Pokemon Red/Blue is on, that the visual boy advance window reads exactly: Pokemon Red - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5 or 
Pokemon Blue - VisualBoyAdvance-M 2.1.5

Hit S'Go when the game is running, it should have three probabilities, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0

When entering into battle with a wild pokemon, the probabilities should change

Next:

Support for other versions of visual boy advance
